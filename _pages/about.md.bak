### Hi there!

I'm Brian, and I do sound, music and implementation for games.

I love cooking and getting owned by my five-year-old at Street Fighter II. I also love hanging out with random farm animals and I generally try to spend as much time outside as possible.

Horror and sci-fi are my specialties.

You can find my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dmb5UOlsZ8TzoT42J-9kRDbhlmLZgtBG/view?usp=sharing)
